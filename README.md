[2:29 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: A quarter has passed yet still no closer. Clues potentially mishandled and a phone now out of order.
The game is still early still much to discover. Hart in the right place but do you have trust for each other? 
An agent of chaos hides deep in the grass. They have purposely lied and haven’t told their last. Uncover them fast or you surely will lose.
Whoever has the most votes will be removed from this group.

[3:51 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Although well intended correction is needed. Hart was out of place and should not be believed in.
The reality Hurts but not in the way you may think. The game ends on wednesday so be quick on your feet.

[4:13 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Kindness was intended but misconstrued. 
Ramifications like puzzles might be misunderstood.
Alliances formed but who can you trust? 
Many fingers to point leads one turned to dust.
Position yourself behind the line.
Is this a trick am I playing with your mind?
So many things to consider where to begin?
Start from the top to let it soak in.

[4:17 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Thus our night ends enjoy what sleep you can. Today will be filled so ready your plans.

[9:49 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: The day has begun! What a time it will be! What would you do if a fishbitch wasn't who they claimed to be? 
Would I reveal my spy? Are these just more tricks? I'll give you until noon. Nominate someone to pick.

[11:22 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: This is all in good fun but votes must be made. Do not try to test the limits of the game.
Another number appears what will you do? I will only take one to dispense the news.

[11:26 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: <Number Redacted, 2nd_Number_Call.mp3>

(10 Minutes later, Cablethekid recieved a callback from the 1st number, after he had recently tried to call it again, 1st_number_callback_to_Cablethekid.mkv)

[1:00 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: An hour remains and the poll is still split. What a shame if the agent wasn't even on the list.

[2:03 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Denise has been removed.

[2:03 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: The poll is now closed what a day to have squandered. You can't change your votes despite your ponder. An innocent woman kicked out of the group. You all remain to honor this truth. Or maybe i'm joking wouldn't that be a twist. I will leave it to y'all to determine if missed.
