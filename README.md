	[11:47 PM] colevaka: then it stopped
	
	[11:47 PM] colevaka: and it hung up
	
[2:29 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: A quarter has passed yet still no closer. Clues potentially mishandled and a phone now out of order.
The game is still early still much to discover. Hart in the right place but do you have trust for each other? 
An agent of chaos hides deep in the grass. They have purposely lied and haven’t told their last. Uncover them fast or you surely will lose.
Whoever has the most votes will be removed from this group.

[3:51 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Although well intended correction is needed. Hart was out of place and should not be believed in.
The reality Hurts but not in the way you may think. The game ends on wednesday so be quick on your feet.

[4:13 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Kindness was intended but misconstrued. 
Ramifications like puzzles might be misunderstood.
Alliances formed but who can you trust? 
Many fingers to point leads one turned to dust.
Position yourself behind the line.
Is this a trick am I playing with your mind?
So many things to consider where to begin?
Start from the top to let it soak in.

[4:17 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Thus our night ends enjoy what sleep you can. Today will be filled so ready your plans.

[9:49 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: The day has begun! What a time it will be! What would you do if a fishbitch wasn't who they claimed to be? 
Would I reveal my spy? Are these just more tricks? I'll give you until noon. Nominate someone to pick.

[11:22 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: This is all in good fun but votes must be made. Do not try to test the limits of the game.
Another number appears what will you do? I will only take one to dispense the news.

[11:26 AM 8/9] Andrew Panton: <Number Redacted, 2nd_Number_Call.mp3>

(10 Minutes later, Cablethekid recieved a callback from the 1st number, after he had recently tried to call it again, 1st_number_callback_to_Cablethekid.mkv)

[1:00 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: An hour remains and the poll is still split. What a shame if the agent wasn't even on the list.

(The poll for who to kick off the discord concludes, the user we'll call Denise is removed)

[2:03 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: Denise has been removed.

[2:03 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: The poll is now closed what a day to have squandered. You can't change your votes despite your ponder. An innocent woman kicked out of the group. You all remain to honor this truth. Or maybe i'm joking wouldn't that be a twist. I will leave it to y'all to determine if missed.

[2:05 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: It is time for a clue since you still remain cold. The answer you seek is really quite old. A hat on the line obstructs the Son. I hope you all are having fun.

(2:41 PM 8/9, Denise rejoins the server)

	[2:41 PM] Denise: I am personally appalled at the childish behavior in this server.
	[2:42 PM] Denise: How could you all think i’m some sort of undercover spy, as i am clearly an older women. I have a friend who’s son mentioned the infamous podcast, F ** kface and I purely wanted to see if it would be appropriate to watch and if the cast was safe. However, i did not expect a riddle at all. 	I just wanted to help out the investigation but clearly i’m not welcome here. I was worried about the cast, but now i’m worried about the audience.
	[2:42 PM] Denise: I found the invite again.	
	[2:43 PM] Denise: At first i enjoyed your enthusiasm and determination, and would want to check in to see how far in you all were. But now, i don’t feel like i’m trusted.
	[2:44 PM] Denise: So many children have called me a “Karen” and i hope you do not think of me as that but more as a person who stands up for herself.

(Denise is then removed again)

[2:47 PM 8/9] Andrew Panton: A brief talk from the void but was it all planned? Are you all playing further into my hand? Focus on the facts or fall for the follies. Despite what you think i'm really quite jolly.
